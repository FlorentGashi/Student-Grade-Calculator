# Student-Grade-Calculator

This is a C program that reads in information about students and calculates various statistics based on that information. The program defines two constants, NUM_STUDENTË and NOTA_KALIMIT, which are used to set the size of an array of students and the minimum grade required to pass the exam, respectively.

The program then defines a struct to store information about each student, including their ID, score, and grade. It also includes a function, llogaritNotën(), to calculate a student's grade based on their score.

In the main() function, the program reads in information about each student, checks for invalid scores, calculates each student's grade and determines whether they passed the exam. It then calculates various statistics, such as the number of students who passed, the average grade among passing students, and the highest score achieved by any student. Finally, it prints out the results of these calculations.

Overall, this program demonstrates how C can be used to perform calculations and manipulate data structures to analyze and display information.
